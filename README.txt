Alternative way of adding CSS

== Description ==

Idea is simple - I needed a way to allow people to add extra CSS without going and (breaking) modifying the template
I'm using roots.io as the base, which uses css-preprocessors, and having someone going in and editing the main css 
file is just pain.

Also, the inline editor kinda sucks, so I wanted to use Codemirror :/

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Extract the zip file to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Install the plugin using wordpress
3. Go to Tools -> Altcss and edit your css
